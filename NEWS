NEWS for rNOMADS

1.0-1
Fixed bug in GetModelRunHour and GribGrab that resulted in the wrong forecast times being returned.
GribGrab now returns file name, model run date, and forecast date for the GRIB file generated
GetModelRunHour now returns the model date in addition to the other things it already returned
You can now specify whether you want the previous forecast or the next forecast in GribGrab
Any code that worked with rNOMADS 1.0-0 should run with rNOMADS 1.0-1 without any trouble.

1.2-0
A major update that provides access to all NOMADS models with the "grib filter" option on the NOMADS web site 
(http://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/).
This adds up to 54 models in all.
rNOMADS now scrapes the model pages to determine the variables, levels and forecasts available for each.
This has necessitated major changes to some functions.
See the supplied vignette link on the rNOMADS page on CRAN for examples of how the new rNOMADS code works.
The lack of a good GRIB file format reader in R is still vexing, and I plan to write a small package to take care of this.
A future version of rNOMADS will call this package to remove the necessity of installing third party software.

1.3-0
Added support for archived model data, and the ability to read in GRIB1 files using the external "wgrib" series of codes.
Also added some nice tools to quickly generate atmospheric profiles and so forth.

2.0-0
Implemented support for the GrADS-DODS data retrieval system.
rNOMADS can now import data directly into R for all operating systems, not just Linux.
Since this is a very major change, I have incremented the version accordingly.
EXISTING USERS SHOULD NOTE THAT MODEL ABBREVIATIONS HAVE CHANGED.
I am sorry for this necessity but I had to conform with the existing NOMADS URL structure.

2.0-1
Fixed some bugs, including a problem with ModelGrid caused by an update in the "fields" package.
Added two new global models.
